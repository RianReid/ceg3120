Project 1

USE IN THE UBUNTU AWS

Goal: Create a script that, once run, will configure your server and user directory to your custom preferences. This script will be the only thing to run on a new system. Internal to the script should be any service restarts needed - a user should not need to do any additional action.
    - For the VIM plugin, NERDTree https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree.git

Project 1 part 2

Goal: This project will be using your script from Project 1 to create & resolve issues via GitHub
- Create issues associated with the feedback given on the rubric.
- Create a git usage guide called Git-Guide.md in the main folder of your repository
     
Project 2-1

Goal: The primary deliverable for this project is a changelog that includes the components listed below. You may do this by using GitHub Projects in your class repository or by manually keeping track of changes. Since we will be building from this project, your log should include a date and/or time implemented. You may choose to break up the tasks into their own changelogs. I would get templating then check with me if you have concerns about your changelog. Changelog management includes:
- A record of changes made over time
- Justifications
- Resources used as a template for your installation / configuration
- Screenshot of the result
